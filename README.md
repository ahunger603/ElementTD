# ElementTD
A very old project I wrote in High School. Uploading in an effort to preserve old projects and allow other to view them.

The project was my first attempt at creating a game without using any assisting game development software or libraries. The game functions properly, but after school ended I didn't continue to add content. 

The game itself was a Tower Defense game similar to Bloons Tower Defense, and inspired by the old Warcraft 3 Custom Map ElementTD.
